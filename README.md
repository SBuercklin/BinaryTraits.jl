BinaryTraits.jl focuses on usability - traits should be simple to understand and easy to use.
For that reason, every trait is binary.  An object either has the trait (positive) or does not
have the trait (negative).

The design is heavily influenced by the Holy Traits pattern as explained in my
[Holy Traits book excerpt](https://ahsmart.com/pub/holy-traits-design-patterns-and-best-practice-book.html)
as well as in Julia manual's
[trait-based dispatch section](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/#Trait-based-dispatch-1).
If you think about Holy Traits as the powerful manual transmission, then BinaryTraits.jl
gives you automatic transmission.  The machinery is the same but it is a lot more pleasant
to use.

*NOTE:* This package is under active development and we may introduce breaking
changes.  Please follow the
[issues list](https://github.com/tk3369/BinaryTraits.jl/issues)
if you would like to contribute to the project or have a stake in
the design.

## Motivation

Just a quick example below.  More details can be found
in our [documentation](https://tk3369.github.io/BinaryTraits.jl/dev).

```julia
# Use package and import desired positive/negative trait type aliases
using BinaryTraits
using BinaryTraits.Prefix: Can

# Define a trait and its interface contracts
@trait Fly
@implement Can{Fly} by fly(_, destination::Location, speed::Float64)

# Define your data type and implementation
struct Bird end
fly(::Bird, destination::Location, speed::Float64) = "Wohoo! Arrived! üê¶"

# Assign your data type to a trait
@assign Bird with Can{Fly}

# Verify that your implementation is correct
@check(Bird)
```

## Main Features

The following features have already been implemented.  Additional features are planned
and logged in the issues list.

* Define traits and assigning them to your own data types
* Define composite traits that exhibits all of the underlying traits
* Define interface contracts required for a trait
* Verify if your data type fully implements all interface contracts
* Define traits/interfaces in one module and use them from another module
