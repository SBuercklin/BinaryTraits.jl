## Traits

A trait is defined as an abstract type that is used as the
type parameter of several pre-defined types - `BinaryTrait`,
`Positive`, and `Negative`.

## Interface Contracts

The positive side of a trait is usually associated with a set
of interface contracts.

## Composite Traits

A composite trait is one that exhibits the characteristics of all
of its underlying traits.  The underlying interface contracts
are applicable as well.
